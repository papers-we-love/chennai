# Papers We Love - Chennai Chapter

This is the repository for the Chennai chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/chennai/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

Papers We Love (PWL) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers. We are open to people of all backgrounds. You can be a student, a practitioner (software engineer, product manager, etc.), a researcher, or just a curious person. As long as you like discussing technical ideas and learning from other people, you are welcome.

We created this chapter because Chennai has a large tech crowd and several academic establishments. One of us (Ganesh) has been reading research papers like crazy recently and would very much like to bounce certain very interesting ideas off other people.

We are just getting started. Let us first meet informally at a coffee shop to decide how we will take things forward.
