# Welcome

Welcome to the Chennai chapter of [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/). Papers We Love (PWL) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers.

We hold regular meetups in Chennai (and online). We select a paper every month. During the meetup, someone will present the paper, followed by a discussion. These meetings are open for all and completely free to attend.
